This tool was originally written to assist in the writing of a doctoral thesis about the Noctes Atticae of Aulus Gellius.  It offers basic search functions and a simple visualization tool.  The database included here contains some internal "tagging" (not properly implemented to support multiple tags) of individual essays ("chapters"), reflected in color choices.

It is my hope that the tool can be updated to be more efficiently written, and made extensible to include other miscellaneous ancient texts.  Its current implementation is woefully simplistic, essentially written like a PHP/MySQL web CMS.

Please email me at jah2220@columbia.edu with any questions or thoughts.
